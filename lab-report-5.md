# Lab Report 5

I decided to go with lab report 4 for my re task as I feel like this lab was where I was able to learn the most throughout all of the labs.

First, I ssh'd into the ieng6 server on my lab account, then I removed the currently existing /lab7 directory by typing `rm -rf lab7`

Then, I created a bash script which would contain all the commands from the lab 4 report using `touch script.sh`, and then entered the nano editor by doing `nano script.sh`

Once inside the nano editor, I wrote down all the commands from the previous lab report into the bash script as so

Then, in order to do the entire lab report, all I had to do was run `bash script.sh` and the entire challenge was done within seconds
